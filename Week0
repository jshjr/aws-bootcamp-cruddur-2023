Worked on studying for professional cert with cantril.io (did not schedule time for bootcamp studies as did not navigate to this pane until too late... I will get better)
had an issue following Andrews IAM video as it pushed me towards IAM identity center where the creation of the admin groups and users works a bit different. just ended up using an existing admin user.

did not creat a true diagram as I will need more time to actually check services to see how to create the architecture. will shedule more time to do so.

trying to get my head wrapped aroung github is a bit of a challenge, but now working on it
basically the issue with me is huburus, where i thought that i was at a good spot to start becuse i already have a couple of aws accounts active, and how to circumvent this is to wind my head back in a little bit
